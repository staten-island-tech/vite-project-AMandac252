            ChroNoiR is a general and vocal unit within Nijisanji (a Vtuber Agency under ,Riku Tazumi, President of the
            company ANYCOLOR㈱ ) that consists of Nijisanji members Kanae and Kuzuha. The unit's name is from the fact
            that both Kuzuha and Kanae like the color black and from there, their name was made from the Japanese word
            "黒" (Kuro, Black) and the French word "Noir" (Black). ChroNoir was foreshadowed and was already unitized
            even before Kuzuha's debut in Nijisanji. Both Kuzuha and Kanae have hit a million subscribers on YouTube on
            their individual channels where they do gaming streams and occasionally post song covers, while uploading an
            episode of their show, Kuronan, every week on their unit channel. Kanae and Kuzuha have both released albums
            of their own under the labels Lantis and Universal Music respectively.

            Unitized on July 17th, 2018.
