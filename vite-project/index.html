    <p class="main-info">
      ChroNoir is a general and vocal unit within NIJISANJI (a Vtuber Agency under ,Riku Tazumi, President of the
      company ANYCOLOR㈱ ) that consists of NIJISANJI members Kanae and Kazuha. The unit's name is from the fact that
      both Kuzuha and Kanae like the color black and from there, their name was made from the Japanese word "黒" (Kuro,
      Black) and the French word "Noir" (Black). ChroNoir was foreshadowed and was already unitized even before Kuzuha's
      debut in NIJISANJI and is currently the only NIJISANJI unit that has their own dedicated Youtube Channel.

      Unitized on July 17th, 2018.

    <p class="lore-info(rough)">

      A brief explanation of their lore(i stole this off of reddit dont hurt me) would be beginning with :
      Kanae, a boy that fell from the sky and who continually reincarnates with his plushie roto who can transform into
      anything and appears in all his outfits. Kanae’s reincarnation is also the reason for his various outfits
      representing what’s he's been in his various lives, a priest, a military officer, etc.
      So Kuzuha always finds Kanae and because Kuzuha is an immortal vampire, he is always there to witness Kanae's
      death. Kuzuha always buries him with the same flower every time Kanae dies. Obviously Kanae doesn’t remember his
      previous lives which is why he sometimes references himself as having “amnesia” and Kuzuha remembering things that
      Kanae doesn’t.

      Their lore is brefily talked about throughout all their songs that they have created.
