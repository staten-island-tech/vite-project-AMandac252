      <p class="main-info">
        ChroNoiR is a general and vocal unit within Nijisanji (a Vtuber Agency under ,Riku Tazumi, President of the
        company ANYCOLOR㈱ ) that consists of Nijisanji members Kanae and Kuzuha. The unit's name is from the fact that
        both Kuzuha and Kanae like the color black and from there, their name was made from the Japanese word "黒" (Kuro,
        Black) and the French word "Noir" (Black). ChroNoir was foreshadowed and was already unitized even before
        Kuzuha's
        debut in Nijisanji. Both Kuzuha and Kanae have hit a million subscribers on YouTube on their individual channels
        where they do gaming streams and occasionally post song covers, while uploading an episode of their show,
        Kuronan,
        every week on their unit channel. Kanae and Kuzuha have both released albums of their own under the labels
        Lantis
        and Universal Music respectively.

        Unitized on July 17th, 2018.
